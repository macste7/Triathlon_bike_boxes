## Aerodynamic Boxes for Triathlon Bike - 3D printed

_This small side project was about creating aerodynamic storage for the Cervelo P3 Triathlon Bike. To 3d print these boxes I used PETG material due to its durability and strength. While creating these aerodynamic boxes I focused also on quick access to tools or essentials._
